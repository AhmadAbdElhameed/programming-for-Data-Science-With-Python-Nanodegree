'''
 In this project, the student had to make use of Python to explore data related
 to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago,
 New York City, and Washington. The student had to write code to (a) import
 the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive
 statistics,
 and (b) write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive
 experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
